          <strong>About Us</strong><br />
          TechGem project aims to empower young girls in underprivileged and
          rural communities by bridging the gap and enabling them to embrace
          technology. Through training, mentorship, and access to technology
          resources, the project aims to foster their skills, interests, and
          participation in technology-related fields. The primary goal of this
          project is to bridge the digital divide and create a more equitable
          society. We strive to ensure that young girls, regardless of their
          background or socioeconomic status, have equal opportunities to learn
          and utilize technology. We aim to empower them as problem solvers and
          provide them with a broader perspective.
