ASSIGNMENT: HTML DOCUMENT STRUCTURE AND TEXT FORMATTING

## Task Description

The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of HTML document structure, the head and body elements, headings, paragraphs, text formatting, and the use of comments in HTML. You will be required to create an HTML file that incorporates these concepts and submit it on GitHub. You will then share the GitHub repository link via Microsoft Teams.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository for this assignment.
2. Give the repository a descriptive name, such as "AZ-C5-HTML "

### Step 2: Create an HTML File

1. Create a new HTML file named "index.html" in your local development environment.
2. Open the HTML file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

### Step 3: Implement the Required Tasks

You need to complete the following tasks within the HTML file:

- Task 1: HTML Document Structure
Ensure your HTML document includes the necessary structural elements, such as <!DOCTYPE html>, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

- Task 2: Head Element

1. Inside the head element, include a `<title>` element with a descriptive title for your webpage.
2. Include a favicon and a few metadata for your document.

- Task 3: Body Element
Inside the body element, create the main content of your webpage:

1. Use appropriate heading tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) to structure your content. Create at least two levels of headings.
2. Write at least two paragraphs of text in the body of your webpage. Ensure that they are well-structured and informative.
3. Apply text formatting to your content using HTML tags. For example, make some text bold, italic, underline specific parts of your paragraphs and apply other formatting tags to your paragraphs.
4. Include comments in your HTML code to explain the purpose and structure of different sections of your document. Use comments to describe your headings, paragraphs, and other significant elements.

### Step 4: Commit and Push to GitHub

1. Add the modified HTML file to your local Git repository.
2. Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message.
3. Push the changes to your GitHub repository.

2. Double-check your HTML file for any errors or typos.
3. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
4. Share the GitHub repository link via Microsoft Teams.
